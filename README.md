The TopOnto package provides tools for testing ontlogy terms while accounting for the topology of the ontology graph and is based on the [topGO tool](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16606683) developed by Adrian Alexa. Different test statistics and methods for eliminating local similarities and dependencies between ontology terms can be implemented and applied. The topOnto package extends topGO to enable the use of any other ontology greatly increasing its utility across biological subject domains.
